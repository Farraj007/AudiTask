**Run this command when you have the files in your device**

        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

**to run the program** 

        python 00_Script/ppt.py



### Some Problems i faced :

as you can see between lines 113-138 this is me trying to copy the content of the xlsx file i made during the config and data we have from 01_Input and making the exact table as wanted to the ppt file but had some issue with my device it could be possible to be fixed but in a different device ." so it might be working but i have to do the right configuration for it with a differenty device and test it out " 
### Table Making
So yeah there is the excel file which is produced during the program but it not used because of the problem mentioned above so i did the table using pptx library . 


**This was done with python 3.8**
